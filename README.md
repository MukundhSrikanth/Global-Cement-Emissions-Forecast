# 🌍 Global Cement Emissions Forecast 📊

Welcome to the **CementCO2Trends** repository! This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting CO₂ emissions from cement production globally. Using a dataset provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-cement), this repository contains a Python script that performs data processing, visualization, and forecasting.

## 📂 Features

- **Data Loading and Processing**: Load and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Create insightful plots to visualize trends in annual CO₂ emissions across continents and globally. Includes Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and grouped bar charts for detailed comparisons.
- **Forecasting**: Apply ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models to forecast future CO₂ emissions and understand long-term trends.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Filter data by continents and income groups to provide a detailed view of emissions patterns.

## 🌐 Data Source

The dataset used in this project is available from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-cement). To access the data:

1. Visit the [Annual CO₂ emissions from cement](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-cement) page.
2. Download the dataset file.
3. Save the dataset as `annual-co2-cement.csv` in the `Datasets` folder of your project directory.

## 🔄 Data Processing

1. **Loading and Inspecting Data**: Load the dataset and inspect its structure, summary statistics, and missing values.
2. **Renaming Columns**: Rename columns for clarity and consistency.
3. **Filtering Data**: Focus on global emissions, specific continents, and categorize by income groups for detailed analysis.

## 📈 Visualizations

1. **Trends in Annual Emissions**: Line plots show CO₂ emissions trends across continents and globally.
2. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Visualize the distribution of global annual CO₂ emissions.
3. **Annual CO₂ Emissions by Income Group**: Compare emissions from 2010 to 2022 across different income groups using a grouped bar chart.

## 🔮 Forecasting

1. **ARIMA Model**: Forecast CO₂ emissions for the next 28 years (2023 to 2050).
2. **Exponential Smoothing (ETS) Model**: Forecast CO₂ emissions for the next 27 years, capturing trends and seasonality.

## 🚀 Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Download the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-cement) and save it as `annual-co2-cement.csv`.
2. **Set Up**: Place the `annual-co2-cement.csv` file in the `Datasets` folder of your project directory.
3. **Execute the Script**: Run the Python script to perform data analysis, generate visualizations, and create forecasts.
